SMCRoute - A static multicast route tool
========================================

SMCRoute is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast routes of a UNIX
kernel. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routing. SMCRoute can be
used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers like mrouted or pimd in
setups where static multicast routes should be maintained and/or no proper
IGMP or MLD signaling exists.

Generally multicast routes exists in the kernel only as long as smcroute
or another multicast routing daemon is running. Only one multicast routing
daemon can be active at a time, so it's impossible to run smcroute and, e.g.,
mrouted at the same time.

SMCRoute is maintained at GitHub. Previously the code has been hosted by
Debian at Alioth and before that by Carsten Schill, the original author.
