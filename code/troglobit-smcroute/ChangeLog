smcroute 1.98.1 -> 1.98.3
 * Cleanup IPv6 #ifdefs and replace IN6_MULTICAST() with IN6_IS_ADDR_MULTICAST()
   This commit cleans up a lot of the IPv6 related #ifdefs, some minor
   function name refactoring and squash of some _init and _enable funcs
   into one for clarity and clearer error messages to the user.
 * Check for existence of asprintf() to pidfile() and add -D_GNU_SOURCE to CPPFLAGS
   using AC_GNU_SOURCE in configure.ac
 * Fixes FTBFS when host lacks IPv6 support.

smcroute 1.98.0 -> 1.98.1
 * Bugfix: Client failed to send commands to daemon.
 * Bugfix: Several FTBFS fixed for GCC 4.6.x and -W -Wall

smcroute 0.95 -> 1.98.0
 * SMCRoute2 Announced!
 * Feature: Support for smcroute.conf file for daemon
   Add support for reading mroutes and mgroups from a configuration file.
	mgroup from IFNAME group MCGROUP
	mroute from IFNAME source ADDRESS group MCGROUP to IFNAME [IFNAME ...]
   Both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats are supported.
 * Feature: Support for signals, reload conf file on SIGHUP
 * Refactor: Insecure handling of pointers potentially outside array boundaries.
 * Bugfix: Invalid use of varargs in call to snprintf(), use vsnprintf() instead.
 * Feature: Add -n switch to support running smcroute in foreground.
 * Refactor: Major cleanup, reindent to Linux C-style, for improved maintainability.
 * Bugfix: Invalid MRouterFD6 fd crashes smcroute, always check for valid fd.
 * Bugfix: Several minor bugfixes; type mismatches and unused return values.

smcroute 0.94.1 -> 0.95
 * Feature request #313278: Added support for FreeBSD
   SMCRoute now builds and runs on FreeBSD kernels.  This was successfully
   tested with the FreeBSD port of Debian using FreeBSD 8.1.  Other BSD
   flavours or versions might work too.  Any feedback is appreciated.
   https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=313278
 * Feature request #313190: Debug logging is now disabled by default. If you
   want to enable debug logging again, start the daemon with parameter '-D'.

smcroute 0.94 -> 0.94.1
 * Bugfix: In case the kernel refuses write access to the file
   /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/mc_forwarding, don't let smcroute exit
   with an error, but proceed with normal operation without writing a
   "1" to this file.  Apparently newer Linux kernels take care for the
   correct content of this file automatically whenever the IPv6
   multicast routing API is initialized by a process.

smcroute 0.93 -> 0.94
 * Added support for IPv6 multicast routing in smcroute. SMCRoute now
	supports addition and removal of IPv6 multicast routes. It will
	automatically detect which type of route to add or delete based
	on the type (IPv4/IPv6) of addresses provided for the add and
	remove commands.
 * Added support for joins and leaves ('j'/'l') to IPv6 multicast groups.
 * Added support for sending to IPv6 multicast addresses to mcsender tool.
 * Added command line option to mcsender tool to allow user to specify the
	outgoing interface for datagrams sent.
 * Added autoconf support for smcroute build.

smcroute 0.92 -> 0.93
 * fixed the "smcroute looses output interfaces" bug (Carsten Schill, 0.93
    unreleased).

smcroute 0.90 -> 0.92
  * fixed the 'mroute: pending queue full, dropping entries' error
    Smcroute 0.90 didn't care about the IGMP messages delivered to the
    UDP socket that establish the MC-Router API. After some time the
    queue for the sockets filled up and the 'pending queue full' message
    was send from the kernel. To my knowledge this didn't affect smcroute
    or the operating system.
    - version 0.92 reads the ICMP messages now from the UDP socket and
      logs them to syslog with daemon/debug
    - smcroute does no further processing of this messages
  * increased the number of supported interfaces
    The 16 interface limit of version 0.90 (interfaces as listed with
    ifconfig) was to small, especially when alias interfaces where
    defined.
    - up to 40 interfaces are no recognized by smcroute
    - this does not change the number of 'virtual interfaces' supported
      by the kernel (32)
    - not all interfaces recognized by smcroute (40) results in a
      'virtual interface' of the kernel (32)

smcroute 0.80 -> 0.90
  * added MC group join (-j) and leave (-l) functionality
    - the options enable/disable the sending of IGMP join messages for
      a multicast group on a specific interface
  * removed the '<OutputIntf> [<OutputIntf>] ...' for the '-r' option
    - they are not used by the kernel to identify the route to remove
    - smcroute will not complain about extra arguments for the '-r' option
      to stay compatible with releases <= 0.80
  * improved error handling for some typical error situations
  * added a test script (tst-smcroute.pl)
  * added a man page
  * fixed some minor bugs
