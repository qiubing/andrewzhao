* Support for detecting link up/down on interfaces
Also requires updating VIF/MIFs and mroutes accordingly.

Optimal, and almost required, behavior would be to handle such
transitions  without losing any traffic over established/active
routing rules.

* Why do we need to specify source address and inbound interface?
We should be able to use reverse-path-forwarding to determine the
source of incoming multicast. Maybe even in the kernel.

If that's not possible we should be able to at least try and support
ADDRESS/LEN syntax as source.
