Some things that should be fixed. If you fix some of the problems described
below, please tell me (walker@clinet.fi):

- sometimes when the program closes a window, the terminal window under
  that gets improperly restored.
  Probably happens because of the cursor movement commands from the other
  end when the screen was written.

- When run from xterm, Minicom doesn't restore the window colors on exit
  (Then again, there is the xminicom script..)

- I've heard that when compiled with gcc under Solaris the rtscts may get
  turned off when zmodem starts. No idea yet why this happens, and
  Solaris users don't all have this problem..

- the scripts are reported not to wait for the shell commands (beginning
  with !) to finish before continuing the script
